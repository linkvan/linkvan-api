# OVERVIEW
The purpose of Linkvan is to connect people in need to the services they require.

linkvan-web is originally a Rails translation of Zendesk's awesome open source [linksf project](https://github.com/zendesk/linksf).

linkvan-web has now being splitted into a NExtJS frontend (https://github.com/linkvanproject/linkvan-web) and a Rails backend (https://github.com/linkvan/linkvan-api).

linkvan-api is developed in [Ruby on Rails 6.1](https://rubyonrails.org/) and is responsible for the admin interface and to expose an Rest API to the frontend.

The linkvan app is maintained by a community of volunteers based in Vancouver, Canada and the latest production version of the web app can be found at: https://linkvan.ca/

## Running the backend in Docker to support frontend development

We have a script that will build docker containers to have the API up and running. The `dev_reset` script will recreate the database, add seed data, and populate the database with fake data. (for details see: https://github.com/linkvan/linkvan-api/issues/116)

After cloning the repository, or updating your branch, just follow the steps below to have an up and running API:
1. cd `< directory where you cloned the project repository to >`
2. bin/docker/dev_reset
3. load http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard on your web browser.

## Setting up an Environment
The [Ruby on Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) will provide you instructions to help you install, configure and use Ruby on Rails.

Once you have installed and configured Ruby on Rails please fork the [linkvan-api app project repository](https://github.com/linkvan/linkvan-api) and clone it to your development computer.

To execute the app on your computer proceed as follows:

1. cd `< directory where you cloned the project repository to >`
2. Start a postgres database locally, for example with docker:
```
docker run --name linkvan_postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```
3. Update your database configuration on `config/database.yml`. Based on the previous command, the updated development and test section could for example be:
```
development:
  <<: *default
  database: linkvan_api_development
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  username: postgres
  password: mysecretpassword

test:
  <<: *default
  database: linkvan_api_test
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  username: postgres
  password: mysecretpassword
```
4. Run `bundle install`. You might need to use [rvm](https://rvm.io/).
5. rails db:create (to create a database)
5. rails db:migrate
6. rails db:seed
7. rails fake_data:all
6. rails server
8. load http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard on your web browser.
9. login with:
  name: "admin@example.com",
  password: "password",
